 * To use the ConfirmChannel, call the [confirmSelect] method on the underlying channel instance
 * to enable message confirmation. After enabling confirmation, you can use the [publisher] method
 * to create a [ConfirmPublisher] instance for publishing messages with confirmation support.
 *
 * @param channel The underlying channel instance to delegate channel operations to.
